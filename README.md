### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me:

My name is Srideep Dornala, and I am a student at the University of California San Diego studying Computer Science projected to graduate in 2025.

My interests lie in many domains of computer science, but I am most experienced in machine learning and software development. The languages I know best include Python, Java, C++, and Javascript.

Please feel free to view my projects posted on my profile.

I am open to collaborate on new projects, and hope to begin contributing to open source projects soon.
